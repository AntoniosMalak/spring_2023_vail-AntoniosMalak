## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
- Introduction to Machine Learning
  * `Supervised:` 
    - <b>Regression:</b> which can predict continuous data.
    - <b>Classification:</b> we can classify our data into classes (discrete data).
  * `Unsupervised:`
    - <b>Clustering:</b> It's a group of similar data growing or held together, or a group of people or things that are close together.
    - <b>Dimensionality Reduction:</b> It's a statistical technique of reducing the number of random variables in a problem by obtaining a set of principal variables.
  * `Semi-supervised:`  a model uses the larger unlabeled data to gain a general sense of the data’s structure, and a much smaller subset of labeled data to learn how to group and organize the whole dataset.
  * `Reinforcement learning:` The central concept of reinforcement learning is based around an “agent” (a computer or robot) that is interacting with an   “environment” (here defined as everything that is not the agent).
  
  - Machine learning with Scikit-learn
    * Use scikit-learn in Machine Learning and how to build models with it.
    * Loading data.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
- It's a nice start to ML and using Ml models like DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, and LogisticRegression with `iris_data`.
- Similarities and differences between random-forest and decision-tree.

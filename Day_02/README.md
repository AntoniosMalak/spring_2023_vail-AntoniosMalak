# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Linear models in machine learning
  - Why we can't use linear models for every problem?
  - Linear Regression Example.
  - What is `.score()`, `.coef_` and `.intercept_`.
* Introduction to TensorFlow
  - What is Tensorflow.
  - Tensorflow for Neural Network Modeling.
* Building a simple Neural Network
  - Build a few models and see the different between them.
  - Use differents activation functions, optimizers and metrics.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
  Build more than DL model and use diffrent losses, optimizers and accuracies.

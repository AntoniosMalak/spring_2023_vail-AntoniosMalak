# Style Transfer

## Topics covered in today's module
* Image preprocessing utilities
* Image deprocessing utilities
* Content Loss
* Style Loss
* Style Transfer

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Image preprocessing utilities
  - Function that allows us to make preprocess to image and convert it to tensor.
* Image deprocessing utilities
  - Function that allows making the process to image convert a tensor into an image.
* Content Loss
  - Compute loss and grads.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
The most exciting aspect of today's assignment on style transfer is the ability to transform the style of an image into a completely different one while preserving the content. Another challenging aspect of this task is choosing the appropriate pre-trained model, hyperparameters, and loss functions to achieve the desired results. Finally, exploring the limitations and understanding how to fine-tune the model for better performance is also an interesting aspect of this assignment.
